# Visit St. George

Here's a quick little site built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It provides multiple pages, interactive design, and tries to emulate the design of a few iconic sites:
* [Sequoia Capital] (https://www.sequoiacap.com/)
* [Visit Utah] (https://www.visitutah.com/)
* [a16z's AI site] (https://a16z.com/ai/)
